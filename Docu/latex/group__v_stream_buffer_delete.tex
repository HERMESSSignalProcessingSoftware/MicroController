\begin{DoxyPre}
void vStreamBufferDelete( StreamBufferHandle\_t xStreamBuffer );
\end{DoxyPre}


Deletes a stream buffer that was previously created using a call to x\+Stream\+Buffer\+Create() or x\+Stream\+Buffer\+Create\+Static(). If the stream buffer was created using dynamic memory (that is, by x\+Stream\+Buffer\+Create()), then the allocated memory is freed.

A stream buffer handle must not be used after the stream buffer has been deleted.
