===============================================================================
   [..]
   The SHA-224 and SHA-256 HASH and HMAC processing can be carried out exactly
   the same way as for SHA-1 or MD-5 algorithms.
   (#) Three modes are available.
       (##) Polling mode: processing APIs are blocking functions
            i.e. they process the data and wait till the digest computation is finished,
            e.g. HAL_HASHEx_xxx_Start()
       (##) Interrupt mode: processing APIs are not blocking functions
               i.e. they process the data under interrupt,
               e.g. HAL_HASHEx_xxx_Start_IT()
       (##) DMA mode: processing APIs are not blocking functions and the CPU is
            not used for data transfer i.e. the data transfer is ensured by DMA,
               e.g. HAL_HASHEx_xxx_Start_DMA(). Note that in DMA mode, a call to
               HAL_HASHEx_xxx_Finish() is then required to retrieve the digest.

  (#)Multi-buffer processing is possible in polling, interrupt and DMA modes.
       (##) In polling mode, only multi-buffer HASH processing is possible.
            API HAL_HASHEx_xxx_Accumulate() must be called for each input buffer, except for the last one.
            User must resort to HAL_HASHEx_xxx_Accumulate_End() to enter the last one and retrieve as
            well the computed digest.

       (##) In interrupt mode, API HAL_HASHEx_xxx_Accumulate_IT() must be called for each input buffer, 
            except for the last one.
            User must resort to HAL_HASHEx_xxx_Accumulate_End_IT() to enter the last one and retrieve as
            well the computed digest.

       (##) In DMA mode, multi-buffer HASH and HMAC processing are possible.

             (+++) HASH processing: once initialization is done, MDMAT bit must be set thru __HAL_HASH_SET_MDMAT() macro.
            From that point, each buffer can be fed to the Peripheral thru HAL_HASHEx_xxx_Start_DMA() API.
            Before entering the last buffer, reset the MDMAT bit with __HAL_HASH_RESET_MDMAT()
            macro then wrap-up the HASH processing in feeding the last input buffer thru the
            same API HAL_HASHEx_xxx_Start_DMA(). The digest can then be retrieved with a call to
            API HAL_HASHEx_xxx_Finish().

            (+++) HMAC processing (MD-5, SHA-1, SHA-224 and SHA-256 must all resort to
            extended functions): after initialization, the key and the first input buffer are entered
            in the Peripheral with the API HAL_HMACEx_xxx_Step1_2_DMA(). This carries out HMAC step 1 and
            starts step 2.
            The following buffers are next entered with the API  HAL_HMACEx_xxx_Step2_DMA(). At this
            point, the HMAC processing is still carrying out step 2.
            Then, step 2 for the last input buffer and step 3 are carried out by a single call
            to HAL_HMACEx_xxx_Step2_3_DMA().

            The digest can finally be retrieved with a call to API HAL_HASH_xxx_Finish() for
            MD-5 and SHA-1, to HAL_HASHEx_xxx_Finish() for SHA-224 and SHA-256.\end{DoxyVerb}
