\begin{DoxyPre}BaseType\_t xTaskResumeAll( void );\end{DoxyPre}


Resumes scheduler activity after it was suspended by a call to v\+Task\+Suspend\+All().

x\+Task\+Resume\+All() only resumes the scheduler. It does not unsuspend tasks that were previously suspended by a call to v\+Task\+Suspend().

\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
If resuming the scheduler caused a context switch then pd\+T\+R\+UE is returned, otherwise pd\+F\+A\+L\+SE is returned.
\end{DoxyReturn}
Example usage\+: 
\begin{DoxyPre}
void vTask1( void * pvParameters )
\{
    for( ;; )
    \{
     // Task code goes here.\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}     // ...\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}     // At some point the task wants to perform a long operation during
     // which it does not want to get swapped out.  It cannot use
     // taskENTER\_CRITICAL ()/taskEXIT\_CRITICAL () as the length of the
     // operation may cause interrupts to be missed -\/ including the
     // ticks.\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}     // Prevent the real time kernel swapping out the task.
     vTaskSuspendAll ();\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}     // Perform the operation here.  There is no need to use critical
     // sections as we have all the microcontroller processing time.
     // During this time interrupts will still operate and the real
     // time kernel tick count will be maintained.\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}     // ...\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}     // The operation is complete.  Restart the kernel.  We want to force
     // a context switch -\/ but there is no point if resuming the scheduler
     // caused a context switch already.
     if( !xTaskResumeAll () )
     \{
          taskYIELD ();
     \}
    \}
