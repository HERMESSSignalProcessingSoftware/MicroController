\section{ADC}
\subsection{External ADC}
Our extern ADC (ADS1148-Q1 Automotive) has 16 Bit with 2-kSPS and is connected with the strain gauges. We have twelve strain gauges and six extern ADCs. There are two strain gauges connected to one ADC. The reason for that is, that each of the ADCs offers two channels with a conversion speed of 1kHz. \\ \\
It is necessary to consider the speed of the built-in sensors. Otherwise we might overload the system with redundant data. Furthermore, it is important to know, that our measurement results are varying. On one hand we have the strain gauges, which values change quite fast. On the other hand, we have the temperature which is a rather slowly altering value. \\ \\
All in all, we decided to use the extern ADC with 1kHz speed to capture the signal from the strain gauge and take for the temperature sensor (PT100) the intern
ADC with round about 2,4 kHz. But we always have the opportunity to regulate
the conversion rate down. That is important, since the temperature sensors only need
a sample rate that is appropriate for 20 values per second.
